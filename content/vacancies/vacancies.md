We are a supportive and collaborative interdisciplinary research group based in the [Conway Institute](https://www.ucd.ie/conway/) and associated with the [School of Medicine](https://www.ucd.ie/medicine/) in University College Dublin. We are broadly interested in understanding how mutations in cancer alter molecular interaction networks and in identifying ways to target these alterations therapeutically. You can read more about our research interests [here](https://cancerdata.ucd.ie/research/). 

## PhD Position

We currently have funding for a PhD student to join the lab. Due to the funding source, this position is only available to students from [the EU/EEA/UK/Switzerland](https://www.ucd.ie/students/fees/eufeeassessment/). This will be a fully dry-lab role, and we are especially interested in hearing from applicants with a strong background in machine learning, genetics or some combination of the two. We have two potential projects on offer. One is to extend our work analysing the role of paralogs in cancer ([1](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202311987), [2](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008466)) to understand more broadly the role of paralog genes in human diseases. A second (more CS/ML heavy) will be to investigate the use of LLMs to interpret genotype-phenotype relationships in cancer, building on our previous efforts to use protein-protein interaction networks for the same purpose ([3](https://elifesciences.org/articles/58925),[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5531859/)).


## Fellowship Support

We are always interested in supporting applications for fellowships from applicants with an interest in our research. If you are interested in joining the lab, please send [Colm]({{< relref "/authors/colm" >}}) an email with details of your research interests.

For postdoctoral candidates, it's worth investigating following schemes:
- [Irish Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://research.ie/funding-category/postdoctoral/)
- EU funded [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie fellowships](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)

For PhD students:
- Irish Research Council typically have an [annual funding call](https://research.ie/funding-category/postgraduate/). We
