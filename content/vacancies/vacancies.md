We do not currently have any funded positions for postdoctoral fellows or PhD students. However we are interested in supporting applications for fellowships from applicants with an interest in our research. 

For postdoctoral candidates:
- [Irish Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://research.ie/funding-category/postdoctoral/) scheme
- EU funded [Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowships](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)

For PhD:
- Irish Research Council typically have an [annual funding call](https://research.ie/funding-category/postgraduate/)
- UCD School of Computer Science have [regular calls for PhD Scholarships](https://www.ucd.ie/cs/phdvacancies/ucdschoolofcomputersciencephdscholarships2022round2/). The UCD School of Computer Science PhD fellowships are only suitable for those with strong computational / data science skills, while other fellowships are open to those from different academic backgrounds (e.g. those with a primary degree in biology).
