abstract: "Proteins operate within dense interconnected networks, where interactions are necessary both for stabilising proteins and for enabling them to execute their molecular functions. Remarkably, protein-protein interaction networks operating within tumour cells continue to function despite widespread genetic perturbations. Previous work has demonstrated that tumour cells tolerate perturbations of paralogs better than perturbations of singleton genes, but the mechanisms behind this genetic robustness remains poorly understood. Here, we systematically profile the proteomic response of tumours and tumour cell lines to gene loss. We find many examples of active compensation, where deletion of one paralog results in increased abundance of another, and collateral loss, where deletion of one paralog results in reduced abundance of another. Compensation is enriched among sequence-similar paralog pairs that are central in the protein-protein interaction network and widely conserved across evolution. Compensation is also significantly more likely to be observed for gene pairs with a known synthetic lethal relationship. Our results support a model whereby loss of one gene results in increased protein abundance of its paralog, stabilising the protein-protein interaction network. Consequently, tumour cells may become dependent on the paralog for survival, creating potentially targetable vulnerabilities.
