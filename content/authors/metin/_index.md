Metin joined the UCD Cancer Data Lab as a postdoctoral researcher to develop computational approaches for CRISPR screens. He is funded through the [AICRIstart](https://www.aicri.org/aicristart) programme. Metin received his BSc in Molecular Biology and Genetic from Istanbul Technical University, Turkey and MSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics & Biotechnology from Istanbul Technical University, Turkey. Then, he completed his PhD from Marmara University, Turkey in Bioengineering. For his PhD, Metin studied the computational prediction of cancer-related variants from protein sequence-, structure- and dynamics-based features using machine learning model. He has also worked as a research assistant and lecturer at Istanbul Okan University, Turkey, teaching many undergraduate theoretical and laboratory courses. 

Metinâ€™s research focuses are CRISPR screen analysis, protein-protein interactions and system biology.
