Olivier joined the UCD Cancer Data Lab as a postdoctoral researcher to study synthetic lethality in cancer. He completed his Bachelor's degree in molecular biology and pursued a Master's degree in Integrative Biology, gaining experience as part of multidisciplinary teams. For his PhD, Olivier studied the functional motifs of the ADAMTS-TSL protein family using a combination of sequence analysis, phylogenomics, and protein-protein interaction annotations. Olivier's research focuses now on predicting synthetic lethality.
