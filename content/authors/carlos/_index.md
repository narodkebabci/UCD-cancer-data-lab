Carlos Vivas Rodríguez completed his Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from the University of Extremadura (Spain). During his university years, he had the opportunity to intern at Systems Biology Ireland with [Dr David Gomez Matallanas](https://www.ucd.ie/sbi/team/groups/gomez-matallanasgroup/), where he conducted proteomics analyses. Due to his interests, he pursued a Master's in Bioinformatics and Data Science in Personalized Precision Medicine and Health at the Carlos III Health Institute, allowing him to return to UCD for his Master's internship. Carlos is developing a pipeline related to bacterial infections in collaboration with [Dr Joanna Drabińska](https://people.ucd.ie/joanna.drabinska) and the group of [Dr Siobhán McClean](https://people.ucd.ie/siobhan.mcclean/). His interests include machine learning, bacterial infections, and proteomics.
