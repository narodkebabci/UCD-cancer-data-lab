Congrats to [Dr. Barbara De Kegel](https://twitter.com/dekegelb) on the publication of her work to understand how the dispensability of paralogs shapes homozygous deletion patterns in tumors.<!--more-->

Tumors tolerate astonishing numbers of genetic alterations, including the homozygous deletion of entire protein coding genes. In this work we explore one potential explanation â€“ paralogs! The paper is out in its final form in Molecular Systems Biology [here](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202311987).
